## PHPAwesome - Debugger

### What is PHPAweosme?
PHP Aweosme is a series of VIM plugins to make developing PHP in VIM much easier and quicker, so developers
don't have to forsake *all* of the features of PHPStorm if they choose VIM

### What is PHPAwesome - Debugger?
It's a project to help make debugging in PHP easier, more like PHPStorm

### Dependencies
At the moment it relies on a plugin called [vdebug](https://github.com/joonty/vdebug) but for the moment we need
to use a fork (found [here](https://github.com/Garethp/vdebug)) that exposes some functions that we need

### Usage
When in a file, simply Press `<Shift-F9>` to run that file in debug mode
